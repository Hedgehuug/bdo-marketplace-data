Used for my start of the day reminder of what I worked on last time to refresh my brain

07/05/2021
- I worked on the requests I send to the api
- I studied PostgreSQL, learned of ways to store and fetch data


08/05/2021
- I learned how to write SQL
- I can send SQL requests to a PostgreSQL database
- Learned about Database Normalization
    - For next time, I need to learn about 'normal forms'

09/05/2021
- Yesterday I learned about data normalization and decided to set up the database structure the next time I touch this code
    I am not yet ready to set this up, I need to learn more about join tables for SQL, I need to write down all the categories
    and I need to make a program to convert the item-name/id pairs to database values while separating them into groups. this
    is going to be a very work intensive task, as I think a lot of other parts of this project will be, will be interesting to 
    see if it can actually lead anywhere
- Next up on my agenda is learning how to link databases

12/06/2021 Saturday
- Yesterday I set up the file-saving setup
- Also set up 1 of the main loops, still need to do this for every single group
