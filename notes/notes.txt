I want to use this file to document my thought-process


Notes:
- Generally the market cycles in BDO are way shorter than real-life
- Price movement is very event-driven
- I need to find an efficient way to store time-series data in a database
    - I need to look into something called a round-robin database




Processes:
- I want daily refreshes to return stock/total-trades/base-Price
- Visualise data in terms of volume
- I want to send this data to a discord bot and display the info



Further Development:
- I want to create relational data:
    - Meaning I want to see what amount of stock-volume makes what amount of change to the market





Development:
- This is an incredible amount of data that I'm going to have to break up somehow while still having it be easy to access
